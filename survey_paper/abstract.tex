\begin{abstract}
With the beginning of the end of Moore's Law\cite{Moore:2000:CMC:333067.333074}, new challenges have been discovered in the never-ending quest to provide faster computers and applications.
Manferdelli \textit{et al.}\cite{4484943} lists these new hindrances as the \textit{power wall} + \textit{instruction-level-parallelism (ILP) wall} + \textit{memory wall} = The \textit{Brick Wall}.

Each of these walls affect parallel and High Performance Computing (HPC), and this survey paper attempts to list the most prominent technologies used in HPC, as well as some of the solutions to the \textit{Brick Wall}, which were discussed/presented in TDT24 2014 at NTNU.
