\begin{abstract}
Since the beginning of the end of Moore's Law\cite{Schaller:1997:MLP:254613.254618}, new challenges have been discovered in the never-ending quest to provide faster computers.
One recent approach to help further this goal, has been to offload work previously done by the CPU, onto the General Purpose GPU (GPGPU).

In recent times, the offloading of more work onto GPGPUs has become more common, and many technologies have appeared to aid the programmers offloading work efficiently in their written code.

This paper surveys some technologies used to offload work from a CPU onto a GPGPU, with a basis in the course TDT24 at NTNU.
