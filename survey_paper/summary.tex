\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

This survey report presents several different platforms, technologies, libraries/APIs that enable and are utilized in parallel programming, on both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems/architectures.

The architectures/systems range from single-core, multi-thread processors, to supercomputers with many concurrently running cores, each concurrently running many threads, to GPGPUs running hundreds of concurrent threads in conjunction with aforementioned multitudes of cores and threads.

Where there is no ``one size fits all'' solutions, there are many good ones that fit each their own niche.
If there's anything the reader should take with himself/herself from this survey of such broad topics as necessitated by the requirements of TDT24, it's that there are three major hindrances discussed in literature preventing the continuation of Moore's Law regarding computing power.
And that there are many different and interesting attempts to conquer these hindrances, many of which rely on parallelism in one form or another.

And it's a selection of the most prominent, and recent techniques and technologies this report attempts to introduce to the reader, showing that while the ``cheap and easy'' path of exponential improvement at constant cost is over, there is still attainable room for improving computing power.
